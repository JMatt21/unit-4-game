# unit-4-game

This project is a little silly fire emblem themed duel simulator where you choose a fighter to beat up the others.
To select a fighter, just click on one of the characters with a green border.
To select a defender, click one of the characters in red and in the 2nd row.
To start attack, just click the attack button.
When a defender dies, the player should select another one to fight against.
If the player's character dies or defeats all other opponents, the game resets.

In Fire Emblem, a weapon triangle exists where Lances beat Swords, Swords beat Axes, and Axes beat Lances.
Lances will deal more damage to swords and also take less damage from them.
Swords deal more damage to axes and take less.
And the same with axes to lances.

This project is a way of practicing javascript and jquery, not css and html to a certain extent.
I currently maintain this project on github: https://github.com/JMatt21/unit-4-game#unit-4-game
